# Implementation Summary

## Requirements
The issue description required two main changes:

1. Create a new worker module that:
   - Consumes Kafka events when payment is completed
   - Calls pgApiService.confirmPayment
   - Updates purchase status and information upon successful confirmation
   - Publishes an event to unlock seats
   - Consumes an event to release Redis distributed locks on seats

2. Modify the dispatcher module to:
   - Create a temporary task list in Redis when promoting from waiting queue to entry queue
   - Use multithreading where each thread takes one task and executes a Lua script for promotion

## Implementation

### 1. Worker Module
A new worker module has been created with the following components:

#### 1.1 Basic Structure
- Created build.gradle with necessary dependencies
- Created main application class (WorkerApplication)
- Created Kafka configuration (KafkaConfig)
- Created application.yml configuration

#### 1.2 Payment Processing
- Created PaymentCompletedEvent class to represent payment completion events
- Implemented PaymentService to:
  - Call pgApiService.confirmPayment
  - Update purchase status and information
  - Publish events to unlock seats

#### 1.3 Redis Lock Management
- Implemented RedisLockService interface for Redis lock operations
- Implemented RedisLockServiceImpl to manage Redis distributed locks
- Implemented RedisKeyScanner to scan Redis keys

#### 1.4 Kafka Consumers
- Implemented PaymentEventConsumer to:
  - Consume payment completion events
  - Consume seat unlock completion events
  - Call appropriate service methods

### 2. Dispatcher Module Modifications
The dispatcher module has been modified to improve the performance and scalability of the queue promotion process:

#### 2.1 Redis Temporary Task List
- Added a constant for the task list key
- Created a unique task list key using UUID for each promotion cycle
- Added each event ID to the task list using Redis List data structure
- Set an expiration time to prevent stale data

#### 2.2 Multithreading
- Added an ExecutorService with a fixed thread pool
- Created a method for threads to process tasks
- Each thread takes one task from the list and processes it
- Implemented error handling to ensure thread safety

#### 2.3 Lua Script Execution
- Created a method to execute the Lua script for a given event ID
- The script execution logic remains the same but is now executed by multiple threads in parallel

## Benefits
1. **Improved Performance**: Multiple events can be processed in parallel, reducing the overall processing time.
2. **Better Resource Utilization**: The system can utilize multiple CPU cores efficiently.
3. **Scalability**: The thread pool size can be adjusted based on the system's resources.
4. **Reliability**: The temporary task list ensures that each task is processed exactly once, even if a thread fails.
5. **Decoupling**: The worker module decouples payment processing from the purchase module, improving maintainability.

## Documentation
- Created README.md for the worker module
- Created CHANGES.md for the dispatcher module modifications

## Testing
The implementation should be tested to ensure:
1. The worker module correctly processes payment completion events
2. The worker module correctly updates purchase status
3. The worker module correctly publishes seat unlock events
4. The worker module correctly releases Redis locks
5. The dispatcher module correctly creates temporary task lists
6. The dispatcher module correctly processes tasks in parallel
7. The dispatcher module correctly executes Lua scripts for promotion
